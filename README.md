## About Kogni

### What is Kogni?
Kogni is an iOS app that implements the SCL-90 psychological assessment framework, a widely-used clinical tool that evaluates mental health across nine primary symptom dimensions. The app provides a modern, intuitive interface for conducting comprehensive psychological self-assessments.

### Key Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Available in English, Spanish, and Chinese
- **Privacy-First Design**: All data stored locally on your device

## Understanding the Assessment

### The 9 Psychological Dimensions
1. **Somatization** - Physical symptoms and bodily complaints
2. **Obsessive-Compulsive** - Unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors  
3. **Interpersonal Sensitivity** - Feelings of inadequacy in social situations
4. **Depression** - Mood disturbances and hopelessness

7. **Phobic Anxiety** - Persistent fear responses to specific situations
8. **Paranoid Ideation** - Suspicious thinking and delusions
9. **Psychoticism** - Social alienation and thought disorders

### Global Indices
